# PyGLImER - A worflow to create a global database for Ps and Sp receiver function imaging of crustal and upper mantle discontinuties 

This project was created in the framework of a Master's thesis by Peter Makus.
It aims to **automate receiver function (RF) processing from download of raw waveform data to common conversion point (CCP) imaging with a minimum amount
of user interference.**
It is largely based on the [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy) project and can be seen as a more powerful and user-friendly
successor of the [GLImER](http://stephanerondenay.com/glimer-web.html) project.
