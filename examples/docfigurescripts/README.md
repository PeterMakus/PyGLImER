# Figures for documentation

The scripts here show how to use the data in that was collected in the 
tutorial can be used to plot from within a script without running the Notebooks.
This (in our opinion) is not only faster, but also more flexible.

However, these script require the data that is part of the examples. 
So, the first part of the `examples/00_DataCollection.ipynb` has to be run
prior to running these scripts.
