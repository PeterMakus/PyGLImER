Common Conversion Point Stacking
--------------------------------

This section is dedicated to *Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking* using
PyGLImER.

Provided that we have an extensive RF database for a certain geographic region,
we can create a volume of those receiver functions depending on piercing points
with varying grades of spatial averaging. Those volumes are referred to as
CCP stacks.
